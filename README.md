# ESP8266 OLED Emoji Display

A simple interactive emoji display system built using an ESP8266 and OLED screen.  
This project focuses on hardware setup, sensor interaction, and embedded system integration.

# Project Overview

This prototype demonstrates an interactive emoji display using an ESP8266 microcontroller and an OLED screen. The display uses **prebuilt Dasai-style (Mochi Dasai-inspired) emoji firmware**, which was configured and deployed to observe system behavior and test hardware integration.

The project primarily focused on **hardware wiring, sensor interaction, firmware deployment, and system testing**, rather than custom firmware development. It was carried out as part of hands-on learning in **IoT and embedded systems**.
